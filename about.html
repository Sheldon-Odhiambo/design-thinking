                <h3>Design for Business Growth</h3>
                <p>The design thinking approach focuses on users/customers you’re creating for. It’s a human-centered
                    design for both products and services.
                <br> We will introduce the design thinking process to your team and work with your team to achieve
                    great products and services for your customers.</p>

            <h3>Our <span>Mission</span></h3>
            <p>To promote the use of design thinking as a problem-solving approach in Africa. We want to help
                business leaders in Africa adopt and execute the human-centered design mindset and process. We
                want to encourage pioneering leaders to foster organizational cultures that advocate for the
                betterment of their customers, employees, and society.</p>
            <p>Our final goal is to turn team members into design thinking coaches capable of human-centered
                design. We believe that when you truly connect empathically with your customers – and design your
                products and services from their perspective – you will find solutions that customers will love.</p>
