                    <p>The design thinking approach focuses on users/customers you’re creating for. It’s a human-centered
                        design for both products and services.</p>
                        <p> We will introduce the design thinking process to your team and work with your team to achieve
                            great products and services for your customers.</p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>To promote the use of design thinking as a problem-solving approach in Africa. We want to help
                        business leaders in Africa adopt and execute the human-centered design mindset and process. We
                        want to encourage pioneering leaders to foster organizational cultures that advocate for the
                        betterment of their customers, employees, and society.</p>
                        <p>Our final goal is to turn team members into design thinking coaches capable of human-centered
                            design. We believe that when you truly connect empathically with your customers – and design your
                            products and services from their perspective – you will find solutions that customers will love.</p>
